 Formatting
=============
Inside plugins/iChat/config.yml you will find the line "message-format"
This is the line you need to edit to change the format of chat messages, it can contain characters, color codes, and variables.
To use colors use the standard Minecraft color codes found here: http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Classic_Server_Protocol#Color_Codes

Available variables:
+prefix - The prefix for this user, or this users group if they don't have one defined.
+suffix - The suffix for this user, or this users group if they don't have one defined.
+name - The users name
+group - The users group
+healthbar - A visual health bar for this user 
+health - The users current health value (Between 0 and 20)
+message - The message the player typed

Example (Default):
message-format: '[+prefix+group+suffix&f] +name: +message'
