 Formatting
=============
Inside plugins/iChat/config.yml you will find the line "message-format"
This is the line you need to edit to change the format of chat messages, it can contain characters, color codes, and variables.
To use colors use the standard Minecraft color codes found here: http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Classic_Server_Protocol#Color_Codes

Available variables:
+prefix - The prefix for this user, or this users group if they don't have one defined.
+suffix - The suffix for this user, or this users group if they don't have one defined.
+name - The users name
+displayname - The users display name (Set by plugins such as Towny)
+group - The users group
+healthbar - A visual health bar for this user 
+health - The users current health value (Between 0 and 20)
+message - The message the player typed
+world - What world the player is currently in
+time - Timestamp, configurable in config.yml. Uses the format for SimpleDateFormat - http://bit.ly/dscw40

Example (Default):
message-format: '[+prefix+group+suffix&f] +name: +message'

There is now the option of having an unlimited amount of custom variabled in the form of +{varname}
These variables are defined in the Permissions config file under the 'info' header of either the user or the group, the same as a prefix.
If these variables contain the static variables such as +prefix, +suffix, +health, etc then those variables will be replaced with their respective values.
If a variable does not exist then it will be replaced with a blank string.

This example will show the users health where +{var1} is located:

Permissions:
---------------------
    Admins:
        default: false
        info:
            prefix: ''
            suffix: ''
            var1: '[+health]'

Config:
---------------------
message-format: '[+prefix&f] +{var1} +name: +message
