 Formatting
=============
Message formatting is defined in the file plugins/iChat/config.yml
The message formats can contain characters, color codes, and variables.
To use colors use the standard Minecraft color codes found here: http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Classic_Server_Protocol#Color_Codes

Available variables:
+prefix - The prefix for this user, or this users group if they don't have one defined.
+suffix - The suffix for this user, or this users group if they don't have one defined.
+name - The users name
+displayname - The users display name (Set by plugins such as Towny)
+iname - The iChat formatted player name (Defined by iname-format) 
+group - The users group
+healthbar - A visual health bar for this user 
+health - The users current health value (Between 0 and 20)
+message - The message the player typed
+world - What world the player is currently in
+time - Timestamp, configurable in config.yml. Uses the format for SimpleDateFormat - http://bit.ly/dscw40

Example (Default):
iname-format: '[+prefix+group+suffix&f] +displayname'
message-format: '+iname: +message'
me-format: '* +name +message'
date-format: 'HH:mm:ss'
handle-me: true

As of iChat 2.4.0 variables are now defined in variables.yml in the iChat directory. This includes prefixes, suffixes, and custom variables.
You can define an unlimited number of custom variables for groups and users, if these variables contain the static variables such as +prefix, 
+suffix, +health, etc then those variables will be replaced with their respective values.
If a variable does not exist then it will be replaced with a blank string.

This example will show the users health where +{var1} is located:

variables.yml:
---------------------
groups:
    admins:
        prefix: ''
        suffix: ''
        var1: '[+health]'

config.yml:
---------------------
message-format: '[+group&f] +{var1} +displayname: +message

=============
Configuration
=============
iname-format - The format used for +iname (Default: '[+prefix+group+suffix&f] +displayname')
message-format - The format used for basic chat (Default: '+iname: +message')
date-format - The format used for +date (Default: 'HH:mm:ss')
me-format - The format used for /me commands (Default: '* +name +message')
handle-me - Whether to handle /me commands (Default: true)

=============
 Permissions
=============
ichat.color - Allow this group/user to use color in their chat messages.
ichat.reload - Allow reloading the iChat config

=============
  Commands
=============
/ichat reload - Reload the iChat config file.
